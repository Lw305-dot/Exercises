# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to your first Python file!  
# Notice that the file name ends with '.py' â€” this tells the computer it's a Python program.  
# To run Python code, you can use the **terminal (CMD on Windows)** or an editor like **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.  
# If you havenâ€™t installed Python or VS Code yet, follow this official guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs  
# Once installed, open VS Code, create a new file, and save it with a '.py' extension (like hello.py).  
# You can now run your Python file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing: python hello.py  
#you can also run the python file by going inbto the root directory that is located and type. python hello.py,...(CD desktop ..Then python hello.py)
# Let's get started with some Python basics! ðŸš€
#Our very first programm is as per below.. NB check the letters and spacing in the code.

#This is the very first program. It will print Hello World! without the quotation.
print("Hello World!")
 
#PRINT("Hello world!")  # ...This will generate an error//NameError.
#print("Hello World!) # ...Due to luck of the closing quotation This will also generate an error/Syntax Error
""" With this 3 illustrations we will transition to the first lesson .."""
